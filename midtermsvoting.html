<!--  <li>Make Sure Your Voter Information Is Updated And Accurate</li>-->
<!--  <p>We are all busy people and it is quite easy to forget to update your voting record with your state board of elections. However you need to ensure your name and address are correct in order to both find the right election station you are supposed to vote at as well as be allowed by the election staff into the voting booth.<br>It is quite easy to update your election information, as it usually is done by simply mailing a brief form to your state’s election department or you can even do it online in many states.<br>When doing this you should also be mindful of deadlines, as many states have complex revolving timelines for when you have to have updated your information to be permitted to vote.<br>Some states allow you to actually register or update your information on Election Day itself or file either an absentee or provisional ballot. In contrast, some make it so you must have updated your information weeks before or you will be refused at the voting table.</p>-->
<!--  <li>Check What You Need To Bring To The Voting Booth</li>-->
<!--  <p>In many states, such as New York, California and others, under most circumstances you can simply appear at the election station, state your name and address, and cast your ballot.<br>In contrast, in now several dozen states you will be required to present some form of paperwork identification that matches your identity. In many states this can be a non-photo identification card, while other states require a government or institution-issued photo ID.</p>-->
<!--  <li>Find Out "When" And "How" You Are Allowed To Vote</li>-->
<!--  <p>On Election Day voting usually begins early in the morning and ends late at night. In the bulk of states the election precincts will be fully operation by 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and close by around 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., with often those in line at those times still able to remain in the process to cast their ballot.<br>Yet nowadays the “when” of voting also includes “early” voting, where you can cast your ballot often several weeks before the election. In some of those states you will be required to provide a valid “excuse” for not voting on Election Day itself.<br>Furthermore, other voting options exist too such as “absentee voting,” whereby you request a ballot and then mail it in because you fall under some excused category for election day, such as being in school or serving in the armed forces.<br>In several states now you can even vote online through a state-run website, while in several dozen others you can email your completed absentee ballot in too.</p>-->
<!--  <li>Remember Your Rights</li>-->
<!--  <p>The franchise has a long and difficult in history in America, and every year it is important to know you are protected in your right to cast your ballot.<br>In every state there are numerous non-partisan voter protection organizations that can provide legal assistance in cases of refusal, intimidation or other potentially nefarious activity. Each major political party also usually runs an Election Day hotline operation with a legal team on standby to react quickly.<br>The state boards of elections, as well as the federal government, also take such complaints seriously.<br>If you feel like your rights are being violated do not hesitate to call a hotline, as that is precisely what they are there for.</p>-->
